## The Black Files: Epstein's Hidden Fortune

---

### COLD OPEN

**[SOUND: Fingers typing on keyboard, then a single keystroke - ENTER]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
October 12th, 2015. Richard Kahn, Jeffrey Epstein's business manager, types an email that will remain hidden for nearly eleven years. His fingers hover over the keyboard as he crafts instructions for moving nearly twenty million dollars. But there's a problem—the man sending the money doesn't want anyone to know his name.

**[SOUND: Email notification chime]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
The email contains wiring instructions for nineteen million, seven hundred fifty thousand dollars. And four simple words that say everything:

**[SOUND: Paper rustling, then pause]**

**QUOTE READER:**
"Avoid public disclosure of Leon name."

**[MUSIC: Opening theme - dark, investigative, building to crescendo]**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
From the 348,381 documents in the Epstein files comes a story of hidden millions, political power, and secrets that reach the highest offices in the land. This is The Black Files: Epstein's Hidden Fortune. I'm your host, [Host Name].

**[MUSIC: Theme resolves, transitions to underscore]**

### ACT I: THE PAYMENT

**NARRATOR:**
Leon Black was already one of the most powerful men on Wall Street. As chairman of Apollo Global Management, he controlled billions in assets. As chairman of the Museum of Modern Art, he shaped New York's cultural landscape. And as of October 2015, he was about to wire nearly twenty million dollars to a convicted sex offender.

**[SOUND: Office ambiance, subtle]**

**NARRATOR:**
But let's back up. Because to understand the nineteen point seven five million dollars, you have to understand what came before it.

**[SOUND: Calendar pages flipping]**

**NARRATOR:**
Jeffrey Epstein had already been convicted. In 2008, he pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from a minor. He served thirteen months in jail with work release privileges. By most standards, his social life should have been over. His access to power, severed. His relationships with billionaires, politicians, and celebrities, ended.

But that's not what happened.

**[SOUND: Phone ringing]**

**NARRATOR:**
The documents tell a different story. A story of relationships that continued—and intensified—after Epstein's conviction. And at the center of it all, one billionaire who couldn't seem to stay away.

**[SOUND: Paper documents shuffling]**

**NARRATOR:**
The financial relationship between Leon Black and Jeffrey Epstein wasn't new in 2015. The documents show regular communication going back to at least 2009. Phone calls. Breakfast meetings. Stock tips shared between the two men.

But in October 2015, something changed. The relationship went from social to financial on a scale that demands explanation.

**[SOUND: Wire transfer notification]**

**NARRATOR:**
It started with an email on October 5th, 2015. Richard Kahn, Epstein's business manager, wrote to Brad Wechsler, Leon Black's financial advisor. The subject: wiring instructions. The amount: ten million dollars now, and another ten million later.

**QUOTE READER:**
"10 and 10 next week. Thanks Brad. Richard."

**NARRATOR:**
But by October 12th, the numbers had shifted. The total was now nineteen million, seven hundred fifty thousand dollars. And the way that money would be moved was anything but simple.

**[SOUND: Calculator buttons, totaling]**

**NARRATOR:**
Here's how it broke down. Fifteen million dollars would go to Southern Trust Company, Inc.—an Epstein entity with an account at Deutsche Bank. That payment would come from Black Family Partners, one of Leon Black's investment vehicles.

Another four million, seven hundred fifty thousand dollars would go to the J Epstein Virgin Islands Foundation—a nonprofit organization with an account at the Bank of New York. But that payment couldn't come directly from Leon Black.

**[SOUND: Tension music building]**

**NARRATOR:**
Because Leon Black didn't want anyone to know he was the source.

**[MUSIC: Transition sting]**

### ACT II: THE SHELL GAME

**NARRATOR:**
To understand why a billionaire would go to such lengths to hide a charitable donation, you have to understand what was actually happening. This wasn't a simple act of philanthropy. This was something else entirely.

**[SOUND: Paper documents, methodical shuffling]**

**NARRATOR:**
The documents reveal a deliberate concealment strategy. For the four point seven five million dollar payment to Epstein's foundation, Richard Kahn provided specific instructions.

**QUOTE READER:**
"In an effort to avoid public disclosure of Leon name, this charitable donation should be paid from your LLC that owns automobiles."

**NARRATOR:**
Your LLC that owns automobiles. Not from Leon Black personally. Not from the Leon Black Foundation. But from a shell company—a single-member LLC that owned cars.

**[SOUND: Car engine starting, then fading]**

**NARRATOR:**
Why would someone use an automotive LLC to make a charitable donation? The answer is simple: to hide the money's source. Public records might show a donation from "Automotive LLC." They wouldn't show Leon Black's name anywhere.

But the shell game went deeper.

**[SOUND: Papers rustling]**

**NARRATOR:**
The automotive LLC needed to be funded first. So the plan was for Leon Black to send money to another entity—LDB 2014 LLC—which would then fund the automotive LLC, which would then make the charitable donation to Epstein's foundation.

Three steps. Three entities. One hidden billionaire.

**[SOUND: Coin dropping, echoing]**

**NARRATOR:**
This is what money laundering looks like. Not the dramatic scenes from movies with briefcases full of cash, but quiet emails between business managers. Wiring instructions routed through shell companies. Charitable foundations receiving millions with no public accounting of where it came from or what it was for.

**[SOUND: Clock ticking]**

**NARRATOR:**
The timing matters, too. This payment coordination happened over several days in early October 2015. But one date stands out: October 13th.

Because on October 13th, 2015, Leon Black wasn't just sending money to Jeffrey Epstein. He was scheduled to meet with him. Face to face. At Epstein's residence.

**[MUSIC: Suspense transition]**

### ACT III: THE MEETING

**[SOUND: New York City street ambiance, footsteps on pavement]**

**NARRATOR:**
October 13th, 2015. New York City. The leaves were turning. The air was crisp with autumn. And at Jeffrey Epstein's Upper East Side residence, the schedule was packed with power.

**[SOUND: Doorbell ringing]**

**NARRATOR:**
At eleven o'clock in the morning, Kathy Ruemmler arrived. If that name doesn't immediately ring a bell, it should. Kathy Ruemmler had spent the previous five years as White House Counsel to President Barack Obama. She was one of the most powerful lawyers in the country, with access to America's most sensitive secrets and direct access to the President himself.

**[SOUND: Papers flipping]**

**NARRATOR:**
The documents show email exchanges between Ruemmler and Epstein dating back to September 2014. Scheduling. Coordination. Meetings. All while she served as the President's top lawyer.

**[SOUND: Clock chiming 2 PM]**

**NARRATOR:**
At two fifteen in the afternoon, Leon Black arrived for his own meeting with Epstein. This wasn't unusual—the documents show Black meeting with Epstein regularly from 2009 through 2017. Breakfasts. Phone calls. Scheduled appointments.

But this meeting was different. Because on this day, Leon Black wasn't just Epstein's friend. He was Epstein's financial benefactor. Nineteen million, seven hundred fifty thousand dollars were already in motion.

**[SOUND: Paper shuffling, tension]**

**NARRATOR:**
What do you discuss with a man you've just sent nearly twenty million dollars? What services could Jeffrey Epstein possibly provide that would justify such an enormous payment? The documents don't say. The emails about the payment contain no description of what the money was for. No invoices. No contracts. No documentation of services rendered.

Just wiring instructions. And instructions to hide the donor's name.

**[MUSIC: Building tension]**

**NARRATOR:**
Leon Black stayed for two hours. The meeting ended at four fifteen. But the day wasn't over.

Not by a long shot.

**[MUSIC: Transition sting]**

### ACT IV: THE DINNER PARTY FROM HELL

**[SOUND: Dinner party ambiance - clinking glasses, low conversation, subtle jazz]**

**NARRATOR:**
Seven thirty in the evening. October 13th, 2015. Jeffrey Epstein's residence.

The same location where twelve hours earlier, the former White House Counsel had met with a convicted sex offender. The same location where four hours earlier, a billionaire had discussed nineteen million dollars in hidden payments.

Now, dinner was being served.

**[SOUND: Wine pouring]**

**NARRATOR:**
The guest list reads like a fever dream of power and controversy. Woody Allen, the filmmaker who has faced his own allegations of sexual abuse. Soon Yi Previn, his wife. Terje Larsen, the diplomat who helped negotiate the Oslo Accords and was instrumental in the Nobel Peace Prize awarded to Yasser Arafat, Shimon Peres, and Yitzhak Rabin.

And returning for the evening portion: Kathy Ruemmler, fresh from her morning meeting.

**[SOUND: Fork dropping, conversation stopping]**

**NARRATOR:**
Let that sink in. A convicted sex offender hosting dinner for a filmmaker accused of molesting his own daughter, accompanied by the Obama administration's top lawyer, and a diplomat who had helped shape Middle East peace.

This wasn't a business meeting. This wasn't philanthropy. This was something else entirely.

**[SOUND: Tension music, building]**

**NARRATOR:**
The documents describe this gathering simply: "Dinner at 7:30. Woody and Soon Yi. Terje Larsen. Kathy Ruemmler."

Simple words. Innocuous description. But beneath the surface, something deeply disturbing was happening.

Jeffrey Epstein—registered sex offender, convicted of crimes involving a minor—was not just maintaining social relationships after his conviction. He was curating them. He was gathering power around himself. Billionaires. Presidents' lawyers. Diplomats. Filmmakers.

And he was being paid millions for... something.

**[MUSIC: Dark revelation chord]**

**NARRATOR:**
The question that haunts this investigation is simple: What was Jeffrey Epstein providing to these powerful people? What could justify nineteen million dollars in hidden payments? What could bring a former White House Counsel to dine with a convicted sex offender?

The documents don't give us a clear answer. But they give us clues. And those clues lead to darker places than most people imagine.

### ACT V: THE QUESTIONS

**NARRATOR:**
Welcome back to The Black Files.

**[SOUND: Typewriter, investigative ambiance]**

**NARRATOR:**
As investigators, we're trained to follow the money. And the money leads to uncomfortable truths.

Nineteen million, seven hundred fifty thousand dollars is not a consulting fee. It's not a charitable donation. It's not payment for legitimate financial services. That amount of money, moved through shell companies with instructions to hide the source, suggests something else entirely.

**[SOUND: Calculator, papers]**

**NARRATOR:**
To put this in perspective: nineteen point seven five million dollars is more than most people will earn in their entire lives. It's enough to buy multiple homes. To fund a small hospital. To transform a community.

Instead, it went to Jeffrey Epstein.

**[SOUND: Clock ticking]**

**NARRATOR:**
The relationship between Leon Black and Jeffrey Epstein continued for years after this payment. The documents show meetings in 2016. Tax coordination discussions. Real estate tax planning involving hundreds of thousands of dollars.

The emails reveal a close, ongoing relationship between a billionaire financier and a convicted sex offender. A relationship worth hiding. Worth nineteen million dollars. Worth routing through shell companies to conceal.

**[SOUND: Phone ringing, unanswered]**

**NARRATOR:**
I've spent weeks buried in these documents. 348,381 files. Emails, schedules, financial records. And the same question keeps coming up: Why?

Why would Leon Black pay Jeffrey Epstein nearly twenty million dollars? Why would he want to hide it? Why would the relationship continue for years after Epstein's conviction? And why would powerful people—White House lawyers, diplomats, billionaires—continue to associate with him?

**[SOUND: Paper fluttering, then stillness]**

**NARRATOR:**
The answers, I believe, are in the documents. And over the course of this podcast series, we're going to find them.

Because this isn't just about Leon Black and Jeffrey Epstein. This is about a network of power that protected a predator. This is about how money and influence can buy silence. This is about the people who enabled Epstein to continue operating in elite circles long after the world knew what he was.

**[MUSIC: Building to cliffhanger]**

**NARRATOR:**
Next week on The Black Files: The insider tip. How Leon Black shared material non-public information with Jeffrey Epstein in August 2009, warning him that he had inside information about a stock approval that hadn't been announced yet.

The email is dated. The violation is documented. And the implications reach far beyond two men sharing stock tips.

**QUOTE READER:**
"Leon just said that actually approval hasn't been announced yet so you now have non-public information and should not trade, but you should know I continue to feel good about the company."

**[MUSIC: Peak, then sudden stop]**

**NARRATOR:**
That's next week. But tonight, as you listen to this, remember:

The documents exist. The money moved. The meetings happened. And the people involved? They're still out there. Still powerful. Still silent.

Until now.

**[MUSIC: Closing theme - dark, unresolved]**
